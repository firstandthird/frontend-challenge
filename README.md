# First+Third Front End Challenge

Well hello there! ðŸ‘‹

We want to assess your Front End proficiency and we've prepared this little test that should not take you a lot of time (ideally). The challenge is to create a simple newsletter aggregator application with a simple subscription form.

Our goal is to identify your skill level in the following areas:

* Front End concerns
* Code semantics
* Modularity
* Attention to detail

As a general requirement, the module should look good on any device and work properly. There should be at least **one more element to select**. Doesn't have to be pixel perfect and, you're free to use placeholder text instead of what's on the design. 

To simplify the task, you can simulate that the form takes two seconds to submit and randomly notify that it has been submitted correctly, or that an error has occurred.

## Completion Instructions:

- Initialize a package using either `yarn` or `npm`.
- Install any required pacakges and prepare the code and folder structure however you like.
- _IF_ you are using ES6 or similar code that must be transpiled, add a `build`, `start` or `dev` script to the `package.json`
- Build the form using your chosen code paradigm. You may use ES5/6, React, or Vanilla Javascript, etc.
- If you are using React:
    - Please `useHooks` as that is what we would like to assess.
    - Feel free to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app) to spin up your application. Try to remember to create an initial commit with the base code, and a seperate commit with the customization to seperate code that you have written and customized.
- Test and validate that the code looks and works as expected when it is run.

### Some other things to consider

- We would love to see included a simple ReadMe with an explanation of the code, and instructions on how to run and view the app.
- An ideal solution would provide a way to load a development server that will serve the solution directly to a browser.
- Please use webpack as a code compiler / transpiler.
- Ideally, the final deliverable will work without any additional input. There should be dummy data wired into the module that _could_ be replaced with an API endpoint and the form submission should indicate success or failure. Think of it as you are passing a finished product along to be UAT'd and code reviewed.

*Good Luck!* And remember to have fun!.
