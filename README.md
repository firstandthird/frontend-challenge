# First+Third Front End Challenge

Well hello there! ðŸ‘‹

We want to assess your Front End proficiency and we've prepared this little test that should not take you a lot of time (ideally). It's a simple Newsletter subscription module.

We want to see your skills, specifically:

* Front End concerns
* Code semantics
* Modularity
* Attention to detail

As a requirement, the module should look good on any device and work properly. There should be at least **one more element to select**. Doesn't have to be pixel perfect and, you're free to use placeholder text instead of what's on the design. 

To simplify the task, you can simulate that the form takes two seconds to submit and randomly notify that it has been submitted correctly, or that an error has occurred.    

Use either plain JavaScript (no TypeScript) or React. The usage of any other library is **completely discouraged** since there should be no need these days. If you're taking the React route, please `useHooks` as that's what we would like to assess. It is fine though (and even encouraged) to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app) if you're taking the React path.

Ideally, it should be delivered as if the only thing missing was the endpoint to which send this information to so everything else should be wired.

You might find a Sketch file too on the [assets](/assets) which you might be able to use on a Mac or you could use [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) in Windows.
